# Audio_Alchemist_group9

Music Instrument Interface for guitarist :
With this application you can play the sound you want with your guitar by connecting it to your computer and downloading all the files. 
It uses the Fast Fourier Fourier to find the fundamental frequency and a GUI interface to use the differents effects for a guitar.
To use our app the steps are explained below. The sound of the "audio alchemist" is provided in the files.


How to make our project work ?

- Step 1 : connect the guitar to the computer and make sure the sound is coming from the audio interface
- Step 2 : Compile the JUCE files (available in the \Source folder) and see if the FFT is working and receiving the sound from the guitar
- Step 3 : Lauch the processing file "bouncing_sqares.pde"
- Step 4 : lauch the SuperCollider finale file, compile everything from the top to the bottom.

Now you can either choose the parameters of the effects with the GUI are let them change randomly with the interaction of the bouncing squares.
If it's easier for you to choose the parameters close the window of processing. Otherwise if you want to challenge yourself and your creativity we can let it on !
